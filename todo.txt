TODO:
- measure start & end time for each extraction
- multicall to get multiple balances based on list of addresses
- support funcs: contract call at given block
- multichain (eth OK, polygon OK, )
- data streams (write file while reading events)
- check that arg names from function signature exist in decimals and filters!
- tests for non-ethereumm networks


Tests:
    - ev without indexed fields
    - ev with all fields indexed
    - ev with randomly indexed fields (not ordered)
    - ev with struct or custom arrays
    - ev without any data
    - ev with dynamic types in data part (string or bytes) -> now fixed-length (32 bytes) arguments
    - multiple ev with same name but diff parameters



DONE:
- tests (better without mock, to get exact expected values after every parsing change)
- dump extractions to csv
- iterative/recursive extractions
- menu to 1) Extract data 2) block # given a timestamp, etc
