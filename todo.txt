TODO:
- measure start & end time for each extraction
- multicall to get multiple balances based on list of addresses
- data streams (write file while reading events)
- check that arg names from function signature exist in decimals and filters!
- tests for non-ethereumm networks
- tests for contract calls
- readme
- models.sample to explain each field


DONE:
- tests (better without mock, to get exact expected values after every parsing change)
- dump extractions to csv
- iterative/recursive extractions
- menu to 1) Extract data 2) block # given a timestamp, etc
- support funcs: contract call at given block, date to block num
- multichain (only evm-based blockchains)
