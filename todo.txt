TODO:
- measure start & end time for each extraction
- dump extractions to csv
- recursive extractions
- multicall to get multiple balances based on list of addresses
- support funcs: timestamp to block, contract call at given block,.. -> create menu


DONE:
- tests (better without mock, to get exact expected values after every parsing change)
