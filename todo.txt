TODO:
- measure start & end time for each extraction
- dump extractions to csv
- recursive extractions
- multicall to get multiple balances based on list of addresses
- support funcs: timestamp to block, contract call at given block,.. -> create menu


Tests:
    - ev without indexed fields
    - ev with all fields indexed
    - ev with randomly indexed fields (not ordered)
    - ev with struct or custom arrays
    - ev without any data
    - ev with dynamic types in data part (string or bytes) -> now fixed-length (32 bytes) arguments
    - multiple ev with same name but diff parameters



DONE:
- tests (better without mock, to get exact expected values after every parsing change)
